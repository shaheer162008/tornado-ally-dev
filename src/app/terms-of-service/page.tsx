                Every project gets a clear proposal that spells out exactly what we're building, when you'll get it, and what it costs. If you want to add something later that wasn't in the original plan, we'll quote it separately and update the timeline.

                The timely success of the project is dependent on the Client's prompt cooperation.

              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6 font-mono">
                You have 7 days to pay each invoice from the day we send it. We'll mention in your proposal if your project has different terms.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white mb-4">5.2 What Happens If You're Late</h3>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6 font-mono">
                Miss the 7-day window and we pause your project until you're paid up (including any late fees). Getting things going again might cost an extra $250 to restart.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white mb-4">5.3 Late Fees</h3>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed font-mono">
                After the 7-day grace period, we add a 2% fee every 2 days until you pay. These fees add up fast, so it's best to pay on time.
