                Before Nexiler, we were all working individually, freelancing, taking on projects solo, and doing our best to help clients one at a time. But <strong className="text-white">Muhammad Shaheer</strong>, our founder, had a bigger vision.

              <p>
                Since 2023, Shaheer dreamed of building a company that could help people internationally, a team that combines skills in web development, AI automation, SEO, and content creation to deliver complete solutions. Not just websites or apps, but real business growth.

              <p>
                In 2025, that vision became reality. <strong className="text-white">Muhammad Shaheer</strong>, <strong className="text-white">Muhammad Saim</strong>, and <strong className="text-white">Syed Muhammad Taha</strong> formed Team Nexiler. Now, instead of working alone, we work as one team with one goal: to grow your business and solve your problems.
